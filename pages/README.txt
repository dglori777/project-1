This is a site about trains and it was devoloped with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It could eventually be devoloped into a site that could be used to buy tickets and view train schedules. Currently, there is only a home page, a login page, a registration page, and an FAQs page. 

---

All pages have a consistent dark theme with a navbar that includes a dropdown menu for easy navigation throughout the site. 

---

The home page is the simplest page. It is just a welcome/landing page. The only content besides the navbar is a jumbotron, two small pieces of text, and an image centered at the bottom of the page.

---

The signup page is where a user can enter their information to create an account. It keeps the consistent dark theme of the other pages and has some input fields for a username, email, phone number, and password. There's also a link to the login page here.

---

The login page is where a user can enter their existing profile information and sign into their account. This page is structured very much the same as the signup page, just with less input fields. There's also a link to the signup page here.

The last page is the FAQs page. This page is self explanitory.
